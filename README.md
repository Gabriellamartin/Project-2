# Music Trends Data Analysis

For Project 2, the group created visualizations to show how music has changed over time. To start Kaleb, found a Spotify Dataset on Kaggle containing data from the last 100 years. Then the data was loaded into SQL to Manipulate the data. Data was used to create an interactive D3 graph along with other visualizations. Finally, we were able to create a webpage. This page contains active links to show our findings and the resources used.
